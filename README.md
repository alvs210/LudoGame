# Features

- 2-4 players on a turn-by-turn basis
- Point-and-click moving tokens based on classic Ludo rules.
- Graphical interface with an embedded Ludo board image.
- Ability to handle game rules like first turn on a 6 dice, kicking another token off the board, etc.
- A dice roll button & "You Win!" win condition
